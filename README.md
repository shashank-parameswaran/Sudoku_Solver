# Sudoku_Solver

The objective of this project is to solve Sudoku puzzles using CNN. Our inputs would be Sudoku images and our model would first identify the images/digits and then apply self-implemented algorithms to solve them. Currently the algorithm only solves 'easy' difficulty Sudoku puzzles. The CNN model was trained using computer fonts as the input is Sudoku puzzles from the internet. The model had 90% validation accuracy
